/ Todo List application for organise work

It is meant to be an application for manage your plans. This is my training application. When I was thinking about what I can do in js/css/html. I came with idea to do it.

I use (or want use):

> CSS3 with SASS preprocessor
> HTML (of course)
> Response based on CSS flexbox properties
> Basic plain JavaScript operations
> Node.js for backend

Funcionalitty that I want to code:

> Add task name, with duration.
> Make plan that can add user tasks for:
  > a day
  > a week
  > a month
> Specified category for:
  > Places (like: Home, Work, School etc.)
> It must be Usefull on mobile phones.
